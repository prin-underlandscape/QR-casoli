# QR-casoli - QR tags for Casoli and La Piella

These data have been produced in the framework of the Underlandscape project, a PRIN project of the Italian Ministry of University and Research.

The data have been processed using the qrcode-gen tool, which is available in https://github.com/prin-underlandscape/QR-tags-generation.

The content is as follows:

- 20230430: the tags prepared for the first recon in Casoli: some were not placed.
- QRcode-230607: the tags prepared for the second recon in Casoli: some of the previous were replaced with the new ones
- itinerario_casoli.umap: the umap file with all qrcodes with active markers
- itinerario_casoli.geojson: the geojson file with all the points and their additional properties (description etc)
- qr_template.umap: the template to generate the umap file from the geojson, using the qrcode-gen tool
- missing item

The uMap map with the data is reachable at https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/it/map/itinerario-casoli_977406.

The content of this repo is used in a publication, and should be managed carefully. The publication contains the QR-code referring to "Riparo sottoroccia verso Buca La Piella", which contains a reference to a Web page, which contains a reference to the uMap map above. On October 26, 2023 data are complete and consistent.
